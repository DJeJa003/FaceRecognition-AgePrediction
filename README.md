# FaceRecognition-AgePrediction
A simple face recognition program (done in Google Colab for a school assignment) that uses machine learning to predict a persons age (young/middle/old) from the picture.
Webcam still not implemented, you need to upload the photos and manually choose the file in the code.
The dataset used in this program can be found from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/faces-age-detection-dataset/data
